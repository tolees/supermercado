- Easy change: Are you thinking about giving the new sofa a certain protection? Decorate your home or change a sofa? Heres the perfect way: just use this Granbest sofa cover for your sofa. Simply change the look of your home and keep your couch fresh and clean. You will be surprised by the new look.
- Choice of sizes: measure your sofa length (including the arm) before you decide. We offer 4 sizes sofa covers: 1 seater (80-120cm), 2 seater (145-178cm), 3 seater (185-235cm), 4 seater (235-300cm). Your sofa measurements tell you which sofa cover to choose.
- Stretch fit: the sofa cover is made of super soft elastic fabric, 95% polyester and 5% spandex material. It is highly stretchy, soft and wrinkle-free, durable and long lasting. The sofa cover fits most types of sofas. And there is a sewn-in elastic bottom hem for a secure fit on your sofa.
- Upgraded: The Granbest sofa cover is made of the latest water-repellent technology that can protect your sofa from accidental spills and daily stains. Good choice for homes with children and pets. Warm Note: Not fully waterproof (spills on the sofa cover should be removed immediately)
- Instructions for use: locate the label "Back" on the sofa cover and place it in the right (or left) back corner of your sofa. Start from the back and cover the entire sofa. Insert the foam pen to allow additional fabric to penetrate deep into the sofa. Easy installation! Washing: Machine wash cold, gentle cycle, tumble dry deep
